# [Project 1: NBA Salary Prediction](https://kaichiinoue.github.io/nba_salary_prediction/)
- Built a model that can predict NBA players salaries based on their performances in the last season.
- Web scraped all the players stats and salary information from a website called [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and [HOOPSHYPE](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/2020-2021/)
- Cleaned stats data so that it is ready to be used for model training
- Optimized Linear and Random Forest Regressors by using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to get the best model
