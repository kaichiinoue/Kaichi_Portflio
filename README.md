# Data Science Portfolio
*Data Science projects by Kaichi Inoue*

# [Project 1: NBA Salary Prediction](https://github.com/kaichiinoue/nba_salary_prediction)
- Built a model that can predict NBA players salaries based on their performances in the last season.
- Web scraped all the players stats and salary information from a website called [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and [HOOPSHYPE](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/2020-2021/)
- Cleaned stats data so that it is ready to be used for model training
- Optimized Linear and Random Forest Regressors by using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to get the best model (failed but tried)

# [Project 2: Predicting Data Scientists Salary](https://github.com/kaichiinoue/ds_salary_project)
- Predicting Data Scientists salary based on their features
- used data science packages such as numpy, pandas, statsmodels.api.
- conducted some EDA to fit into the model.
- built a model that can predict a salary of a data scientist based on their features
